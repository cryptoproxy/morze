# morze
Translator from EN / RU alphabet to Morse code -- --- .-.  --... .  ) 

hi i'm new to programming, this is my first project (great idea right?)

originally made for tg bot but quickly rewrote for github

if you are translating from Morse code, use "./" for spaces, I have not figured out how to implement them


[the project was made by me personally, no one helped me]
